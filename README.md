# Waste-Haste

Two player competitive trash sorting game made using Unity. Each player has a trash can and a recycling bin. An item will appear on screen for a few seconds, and the player who sorts the item correctly first will get a point. If they answer incorrectly, they will not gain a point, and the opponent player still has the chance to answer correctly. The player who sorts the most items correctly wins. Trash cans and recycling bins were created as the alternative controller which were powered by a teensy. When a player puts the lid on the can, it registers as an input for the corresponding can.
